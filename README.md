## Problem statement -

  Create an Express MVC based REST API for a Ecommerce website. Take ideas from
  flipkart.com or amazon.in. The API should have following features -

      1) API to signup, login, forgot password etc. use PassportJS if required.
      2) API to list products, create a product, view information of a particular product,
      delete a product, edit a product etc. you can think of more API by taking
      reference from above mentioned websites. Extra skill score will be given for this
      intuitive thinking
      3) API to add products to cart and remove products from cart.
      4) All APIs should give response in a proper standard format.

Create middlewares and libraries wherever you feel is required. Extra marks will be
given for careful structuring of the project and quality of code. You have to follow all the
guidelines taught in the sessions.

Host this code in a github repository as well and send the link of that repository in the
submission.

Handle all error cases carefully to make sure that your nodejs application doesnâ€™t crash.
